            <em><h2>Description:</h2></em>
            <p>
                Brooklyn pizza is a true slice of New York's culinary charm, known for its thin,
                crispy crust that is perfectly chewy and foldable. The dough is hand-tossed to create a
                slightly charred, airy base, topped with a rich tomato sauce, melted mozzarella, and various 
                flavorful toppings. Whether you're enjoying the classic Margherita or indulging in a pepperoni
                slice with goeey cheese, every bite is a perfect harmony of bold flavors and satisfying textures.

            <br><em><h2>Directions:</h2></em>
            <ol>
                <li>Make the dough: Pour warm water into a large bowl,
                    then sprinkle yeast over the top. Let stand for for 5 minutes.
                    Stir in cold water and salt. Stir in flour, 1 cup at a time until incorporated.
                </li><br>
                <li>Knead dough on floured surface until smooth, about 10 minutes.</li><br>
                <li>Divide in half and form into two tight dough </li><br>
                <li>Remove dough from the refrigerator one hour prior to using</li><br>
                <li>Preheat the oven, with a pizza stone on the lowest rack, to 550 degrees
                    Farenheit (288 degrees celsius). Lightly dust a pizza peel with flour.
                </li><br>
                <li>Prepare the first pizza: Lightly dust one dough ball with flour and stretch gradually 
                    until about 14 inches in diameter, or about the size of the pizza stone. Place on the floured peel.
                </li><br>
                <li>Lay 1/2 of the mozzarella on the crust, then sprinkle 1/4 teaspoon oregano and 1/8 
                    teaspoon pepper over the top. Randomly arrange 1/4 cup crushed tomatoes over the pizza, leaving some
                    empty areas, then drizzle 1 tablespoon olive oil over top.
                </li><br>
                <li>
                    Make sure the dough will release from the peel easily. Place the tip of the peel at the back of 
                    the preheated pizza stone, and remove the peel so that the pizza is left on the stone.
                </li><br>
                <li> Bake in the preheated oven until the crust begins to brown, 4-6 minutes</li><br>
                <li>
                    Slide the pizza onto the peel and remove from the oven; then slide off the peel onto a work surface. 
                    Sprinkle 1/2 of the basil leaves randomly over the pizza. Cut into the wedges and serve. 
                </li><br>
