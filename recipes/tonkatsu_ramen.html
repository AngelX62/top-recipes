        <em><h2>Description:</h2></em>
        <p>
            Tonkatsu Shoyu Ramen is a mouthwatering fusion of flavors, combining the richness of
            crispy, golden-fried pork cutlet (tonaktsu) with the savory depth of soy sauce-based broth (shoyu).
            The broth, simmered to perfection, offers a delicate balance of umami and subtle sweetness, 
            enveloping tender ramen noodles that are cooked to a perfect chew. Topped with the succulent pork
            cutlet, soft boiled eggs, fresh green onions, and a sprinkle of sesame seeds, this dish offers layers 
            texture and taste in every bite. Each spoonful is a comforting blend of crispy, juicy pork and rich,
            aromatic broth, making Tonkatsu Shoyu Ramen a satisfying and unforgettable meal.

        <em><h2>Instructions:</h2></em>
        <ol>
            <li>Fill a small pot halfway with water. Bring to a boil; add egg and
                cook in boiling water for 15 minutes. Drain. Run cold water over egg and set
                aside to cool.
            </li><br>
            <li>
                Pour sesame oil into a large skillet. Lay pork slices in oil. Cover pork with 1 tablespoon olive oil, 1/2 tablespoon
                sesame seeds, 1/2 of the basil, and 1/2 of the sage. Flip and cover pork with these remaining ingredients:
                1 tablespoon olive oil, 1/2 tablespoon sesame seeds, basil, and sage.
            </li><br>
            <li>Cook pork, covered, over medium-low heat, until evenly browned on the bottom, about 5 minutes. Flip and continue cooking until 
                second side is browned, about 5 minutes more. Removed from heat.
            </li><br>
            <li>Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Cook ramen noodles in boiling water until tender, about 3 minutes. Drain in a colander set
                in the sink; rinse noodles until water runs clear. Return noodles to the pot.
            </li><br>
            <li>Stir kombu, bonito stock, soy sauce, and miso paste into noodles. Cook, stirring with chopsticks, over medium heat, until miso paste
                is dissolved, 3-5 minutes. Transfer noodles to a serving bowl.
            </li><br>
            <li>Peel and cut egg in half lengthwise. Place egg, pork slices, and fish paste slices over noodles. Garnish with tonkatsu sauce, ginger, 
                green onion, and black pepper.
