            <em><h2>Description:</h2></em>
            <p>
                Tonkatsu Shoyu Ramen is a mouthwatering fusion of flavors, combining the richness of
                crispy, golden-fried pork cutlet (tonaktsu) with the savory depth of soy sauce-based broth (shoyu).
                The broth, simmered to perfection, offers a delicate balance of umami and subtle sweetness, 
                enveloping tender ramen noodles that are cooked to a perfect chew. Topped with the succulent pork
                cutlet, soft boiled eggs, fresh green onions, and a sprinkle of sesame seeds, this dish offers layers 
                texture and taste in every bite. Each spoonful is a comforting blend of crispy, juicy pork and rich,
                aromatic broth, making Tonkatsu Shoyu Ramen a satisfying and unforgettable meal.

            <em><h2>Instructions:</h2></em>
            <ol>
                <li>Fill a small pot halfway with water. Bring to a boil; add egg and
                    cook in boiling water for 15 minutes. Drain. Run cold water over egg and set
                    aside to cool.
                </li><br>
                <li>
                    Pour sesame oil into a large skillet. Lay pork slices in oil. Cover pork with 1 tablespoon olive oil, 1/2 tablespoon
                    sesame seeds, 1/2 of the basil, and 1/2 of the sage. Flip and cover pork with these remaining ingredients:
                    1 tablespoon olive oil, 1/2 tablespoon sesame seeds, basil, and sage.
                </li><br>
                <li>Cook pork, covered, over medium-low heat, until evenly browned on the bottom, about 5 minutes. Flip and continue cooking until 
                    second side is browned, about 5 minutes more. Removed from heat.
                </li><br>
                <li>Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Cook ramen noodles in boiling water until tender, about 3 minutes. Drain in a colander set
                    in the sink; rinse noodles until water runs clear. Return noodles to the pot.
                </li><br>
                <li>Stir kombu, bonito stock, soy sauce, and miso paste into noodles. Cook, stirring with chopsticks, over medium heat, until miso paste
                    is dissolved, 3-5 minutes. Transfer noodles to a serving bowl.
                </li><br>
                <li>Peel and cut egg in half lengthwise. Place egg, pork slices, and fish paste slices over noodles. Garnish with tonkatsu sauce, ginger, 
                    green onion, and black pepper.
